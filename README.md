# SerialConsole

## What is it?

SerialConsole is a simple console meant to be use as a testing console for serial communications (RS232). It has been made to compensate for a lack of functionalities of the Arduino Serial Monitor.

SerialConsole adds to the Arduino Serial Monitor some functionalities like more settings to set the connection and the possibility to send binary or integer in additions to string.

SerialConsole is made in C++ under Visual Studio 2015 and uses Windows Forms. It is only working under Microsoft Windows (8.1 or later). Its source code is under GNU GPL v3 (see SerialConsole/LICENCE.md for more information).
